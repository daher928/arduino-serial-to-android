# BMW_Display_System_Part2 [Ongoing]

Part2 of BMW Display System

Part 1 reference -> https://github.com/daher928/BMW_Display_System_Part1/

*Part 2's incentive is testing our BMW display system application in a real environment: A real vehicle with real-time data while driving.*

### Major features and modification of this part over part I:

*  Replacing TCP connection (Between PC & Android device) with USB connection, enabling data receiving from vehicle's sensors.
  * For ease of development, we divide this part into 2 phases:
          (A) The emulation phase: using Arduino as the source and data transmitter.
          (B) When *A* works, we plug in a real moving vehicle.
          
* Cloud storage for test results and possible aggregations (Statistics)

* Log-in and User registeration ability.

* UI improvements
